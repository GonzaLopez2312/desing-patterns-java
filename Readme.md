# DESIGN PATTERNS IN JAVA

This project was created to consolidate my knowledge about Design Patterns, and to provide simple examples
demonstrating  their use.

Each folder contains a different Pattern, with an implementation that follows its rules. Additionally, 
each folder includes an *Explanation* file where I summarize the pattern's use, highlight some points
to take in consideration, and explain how does the provided example implements the pattern.

The idea is to continue expanding the repository with more examples of more patterns over time.


## Implemented Patterns

So far, the list of Patterns that are already included in the repository is below. Each item links to
a brief explanation and example implementation.

- [Abstract Factory](./src/main/java/com/packages/AbstractFactory/AbstractFactory%20Explanation.md)
- [Adapter](./src/main/java/com/packages/Adapter/Adapter%20Explanation.md)
- [Command](./src/main/java/com/packages/Command/Command%20Explanation.md)
- [DAO (Data Access Object)](./src/main/java/com/packages/DAO/DAO%20Explanation.md)
- [Decorator](./src/main/java/com/packages/Decorator/Decorator%20Explanation.md)
- [DTO (Data Transfer Object)](./src/main/java/com/packages/DTO/DTO%20Explanation.md)
- [Facade](./src/main/java/com/packages/Facade/Facade%20Explanation.md)
- [Factory](./src/main/java/com/packages/Factory/Factory%20Explanation.md)
- [Memento](./src/main/java/com/packages/Memento/Memento%20Explanation.md)
- [Observer](./src/main/java/com/packages/Observer/Observer%20Explanation.md)
- [Prototype](./src/main/java/com/packages/Prototype/Prototype%20Explanation.md)
- [Proxy](./src/main/java/com/packages/Proxy/Proxy%20Explanation.md)
- [Singleton](./src/main/java/com/packages/Singleton/Singleton%20Explanation.md)
- [Strategy](./src/main/java/com/packages/Strategy/Strategy%20Explanation.md)

## Why this project?

While reviewing design patterns, I realized that hands on practice is my best way to internalize concepts.  
This repository allowed me to explore each pattern in isolation, understand its purpose, and reinforce my Java development skills through practical examples.
Besides, the idea is to help anyone who is studying design patterns and need to see an example to understand better how its used.

## How to Run the Examples

Each pattern includes a minimal runnable example.

To run them:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse).
3. Navigate to the desired pattern folder.
4. Run the `Main` class (e.g., `ObserverMain`, `ProxyMain`) to see the pattern in action.
5. You can also read the `Explanation.md` file to understand the concept and see the expected output.
